Addition:
If you use Simple Social Sharing code in your application you must mention it in application UI with string "Used Simple-Social-Sharing (c) 2011-2012, Sergey Tarasevich" (e.g. in some "About" section). If you don't want or you can't do it then you can make request for permission not to mention Simple Social Sharing in your app. 
Email: nostra13[at]gmail[dot]com.
Also I will be grateful to you if you'll allow to mention your application at Simple Social Sharing page on Github (https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Simple-Social-Sharing) in "Applications using Simple Social Sharing" section.
